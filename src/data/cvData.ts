      description:
        '<strong>Project Description</strong><br>This project was to develop a cloud PBX for a large telecommunications service provider from scratch to production release. This software is distributed as a service for end users and consists of three user applications: a client web application for managing their PBX node, an admin web application for client management, and a cross-platform (Android and iOS) softphone mobile app.<br><br><strong>Activities and responsibilities</strong><br>Development was based on the <u>SCRUM</u>, with 2-3 week sprints and daily stand-ups held by me. All 14 team members worked <u>remotely</u>, and communications were based on <u>Discord</u> and Telegram. I planned each phase of the project in detail, including possible <u>risks</u> and actions to prevent them. Each phase ended with a demo presentation for the customer. I used <u>Postman</u> and <u>SIP softphones</u> to check out results and dig into bugs with the team. Developed mobile apps were listed in stores set up by me in <u>App Store Connect</u> and <u>Play Store Console</u>.<br>The only input provided was a 2-page document with key req-s, so my main objective was to design all product features. I used to work closely with the customer to collect their desires and to ensure that my product decisions based on deep market research met their expectations. The main artifacts of my activity as an Analyst on this project are the <u>SRS</u> and user manuals. Key tools used are <u>Figma</u> for prototyping, <u>Wiki-based service</u> for requirements, and <u>Google suite</u> (Drive, Sheets, and Docs) for manuals and some other docs.',
